Fractol is another project from the 42 school. The goal here was to produce several fractals graphical rendering using the 42 graphical library, the minilibx (https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).

It is the first graphical project I have ever done. I chose to do Mandelbrot, Julia and Axone.

Here is some videos to illustrate this project.
